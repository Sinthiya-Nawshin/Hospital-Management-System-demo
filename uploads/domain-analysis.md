# Lab 1: Domain Analysis
## Introduction
### An Integrated Hospital Management System (HMS)

The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a specialized relational database solution designed to automate and unify the core clinical, administrative, and financial operations of a modern healthcare facility. In a complex environment involving multiple interconnected departments, such as Cardiology, Neurology, and Pediatrics - maintaining high standards of patient care and operational safety is paramount. The system acts as a central hub, integrating various entities including doctors, patients, admissions, and pharmaceutical resources into a cohesive digital structure.

Currently, many healthcare providers face significant operational bottlenecks due to manual, paper-based workflows. Fragmented record-keeping for patient medical history, physical doctor schedules, and medication inventories is not only inefficient but also prone to critical human errors. Challenges such as double-booking appointments, mismanaging room occupancy, and potential safety risks, like prescribing medication to a patient with a recorded allergy highlighting the urgent need for a robust digital intervention. Furthermore, manual billing and discharge processes often lead to administrative delays and financial inconsistencies.

The proposed HMS establishes a secure, normalized database framework to streamline these workflows. By centering the system around the Patient entity, the system ensures that medical records, appointments, ward admissions, and prescriptions are synchronized in real-time. The implementation of ECA (Event-Condition-Action) rules and advanced triggers provides a layer of automated safety and logic. This includes enforcing business hours (09:00–17:00), validating patient ages to prevent future-dated entries, and ensuring room assignments strictly follow privacy and gender-matching protocols.

The expected outcomes of this project are measurable improvements in both clinical accuracy and organizational efficiency. By reducing data redundancy normalization, the system provides a reliable "source of truth" for healthcare providers. Key results include faster appointment turnarounds, eliminated scheduling conflicts, and a rigorous financial clearance process that prevents patient discharge until all pending bills are settled. Ultimately, this system serves as a scalable foundation for future healthcare information systems, ensuring secure data storage and enhanced decision-making across the hospital.


## 1. Problem Definition

### Current State
The following diagram (Figure 1.1) presents that the Hospital currently relies on disparate, often paper-based or loosely connected systems to manage an ecosystem of internal staff and external actors. Process bottlenecks occur primarily in schedule coordination, patient safety verifications, and financial reconciliation.

### Desired State
In the desired state, the new Hospital Management System (HMS) serves as the centralized source of truth. Data flows seamlessly through strict automated rules (Event-Condition-Action). 

![](./assets/hms-desired-state.drawio.svg)
*Figure 1.2. The Rich Picture of the Desired State of Hospital Management System.*

When a receptionist registers a patient, data constraints immediately ensure validity. When scheduling, the system actively blocks overlapping appointments and enforces business hours. During treatment, doctors are automatically blocked from prescribing medications if the patient has a recorded allergy. Finally, clinical and billing modules are deeply integrated so every bill corresponds to a concrete service, and the system automatically prevents the discharge of any patient with unpaid balances.

## 5. Context Map
The Context Map (Figure 1.4) visualises the domain boundaries and integration relationships for the Hospital Management Systems Portal. It identifies ownership, primary responsibilities, and key data flows so teams can design interfaces, data mappings and integration patterns with clear service contracts and compliance controls.

![](./assets/hms-context-map.drawio.svg)

*Figure 1.4. The Context Map of the Hospital Management Systems Portal.*

The Context Map is organised into the following contexts:

**Core Domain — Admission & Appointments:** Owns the primary healthcare lifecycle. This includes the Patient registry, Appointment scheduling, Inpatient Admissions, and Prescriptions. It is responsible for critical business logic such as preventing appointment overlaps, enforcing room privacy constraints, and cross-referencing prescriptions with the Patient Allergy records. 

**Supporting Subdomains — Financial & Billing:** Owns the Billing context. It consumes data from the Core Domain (Admissions, Appointments, Ambulance trips) to generate invoices. This context governs the discharge clearance process by locking Core Domain admission updates if unpaid bills exist. 

**Supporting Subdomains — Resource & Inventory Management:** Includes the Room management, Pharmacy (Medications), Medical Equipment, and Ambulance fleet. This context ensures resources are accurately tracked, priced, and maintained without negative values or duplicate registrations.

**Generic (Internal) — HR & Administration:** Includes Department structuring, Doctor profiles (with email validations), Visitor tracking, and Patient Feedback. 

**Generic (External) — Visitors & Insurance Companies:** Includes Visotrs who visit Patients with Patients ID and name, Insurance companies with each Patients information and billing.
